```bash
# Platform-specific builds
./run.sh build android    # Build Android APK
./run.sh build ios        # Build iOS app
./run.sh build linux      # Build Linux executable
./run.sh build macos      # Build macOS app
./run.sh build windows    # Build Windows executable

# Debug vs Release builds
./run.sh build android debug    # Debug build
./run.sh build android release  # Release build
```

## Permissions Setup

### Android Permissions
The app requires the following permissions (automatically requested at runtime):
- `BLUETOOTH` - Basic Bluetooth functionality
- `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN` - Bluetooth device management
- `BLUETOOTH_SCAN` - Scan for nearby devices (Android 12+)
- `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` - Connect to devices (Android 12+)
- `BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE` - Make device discoverable (Android 12+)
- `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` - Required for Bluetooth scanning
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` - Enhanced location access

### iOS/macOS Permissions
- Bluetooth usage permissions (automatically requested)

### Linux/Windows
- Bluetooth access (may require running with appropriate privileges)

## Dependencies

The project uses these key Flutter packages:
- `flutter_bluetooth_serial`: Bluetooth connectivity (Android/Linux)
- `flutter_blue_plus`: BLE connectivity (iOS/macOS/Windows)
- `permission_handler`: Runtime permission management
- `provider`: State management
- `google_fonts`: Typography
- `universal_platform`: Platform detection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

1. **Flutter SDK issues:**
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Platform-specific issues:**
   - **Android**: Ensure Android SDK is properly installed and licenses accepted
   - **iOS**: Make sure Xcode is up to date and licenses accepted
   - **Linux**: Install required development packages
   - **Windows**: Ensure Visual Studio with C++ tools is installed

3. **Dependency issues:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub cache repair
   flutter pub get
   ```

### Development Tips

1. **Testing Bluetooth functionality:**
   - Requires physical devices (emulators don't support Bluetooth)
   - Use two physical devices for complete testing

2. **Debugging:**
   ```bash
   flutter logs          # View runtime logs
   flutter analyze       # Static analysis
   flutter test          # Run tests
   flutter doctor        # Check setup issues
   ```

3. **Performance profiling:**
   ```bash
   flutter run --profile  # Profile mode
   ```

## Development Environment

### Recommended VS Code Extensions
- Flutter
- Dart
- Flutter Intl
